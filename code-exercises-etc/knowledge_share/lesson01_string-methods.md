# String methods

During class, we said you don't need to memorize all the string methods that are out there -- you just need a basic understanding of how they work, how to use them, AND, where to look them up later ;-)  That last bit of info is... on the Python documentation website!
https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods

* NOTE: Always keep an eye out for Python VERSION info -- we use Python 2.7.6 in class, so make sure you're looking at docucmentation for Python version 2.7.*!
